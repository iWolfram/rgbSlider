# rgbSlider
CPSC1519 - Assignment 2
## Description
This is my 2nd assignment for the iOS Development course I took at the Northern Alberta Institasdf of Technology (NAIT).
This is a simple application that allows a user change the background color based on the sliders position. Additionally, they
can manually input the integer value on either textfield then tapping the "Change" button.
